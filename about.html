          <h1>Food Talk</h1>
          <p>One important thing that I always consider a non-negotiable no matter what I’m talking about that day: describe the food. I sometimes forget because I get wrapped up in the gab fest, but it’s really important to me that I communicate to you, my food friends, what the FOOD is like and even more importantly, why I love it.</p>
